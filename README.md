These are merely python scripts I wrote to help explore some of the concepts and algorithms from the outstanding free textbook [*The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing*](http://www.dspguide.com/). I make no pretense that these are good scripts, and there are certainly far better implementations. Mostly its an excuse to relearn some python after 15 years away..

This is a work in progress since I'm currently studying the material.

Some spreadsheets are included to help further analyze the examples from the text. Or in some cases to visualize data, for example Ch3/zerohold.xlsx which visualizes a zeroth-order hold using data generated from the corresponding python script. Excel because I haven't yet spent enough time to figure out Octave very much... :(
